Our project aims to visualize the popularity of many programming language with various types of programmers utilizing the stack overflow developer survey for 2019. We will create a bar chart showing the number of programmers utilizing each language polled divided into various categories such as if a programmer is a hobbyist or not, years spent programming, country of origin, education level, etc. with different visualizations for each. Important analyses we can do are looking at which programming languages are most commonly used by the highest paid programmers, and to see which languages are most important to know to be competitive in the market. 

NOTE

To use this this code, you'll need to download the data from here: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey

Move the .csv into the data/developer_survey_2019 folder, run the Jupyter Notebook, and you'll be good to go! :)
